</h3>

<p>Here we are trying to use conditional adversarial networks to solve the general purpose solution of the image-to-image translation. This network can be used for the segmentation, coloring, or styling of an image given the dataset. Here we are trying to convert satellite images into Google map type images.</p>
<h3> Dataset </h3>
<p>The data set was downloaded from Kaggle which was specifically made for this kind of task. it contains combine images of input and target which we split during preprocessing. YOu can find more details <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikramtiwari/pix2pix-dataset"> HERE </p>
